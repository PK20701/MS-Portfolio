    "### **Why We Used Pair Plots and Correlation Plot?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Pair Plot:**  \n",
    "- A pair plot visualizes relationships between multiple numerical variables using scatterplots.\n",
    "- It helps in understanding **distributions, trends, and separability** of features, which are crucial for classification.  \n",
    "- It highlights **linear and nonlinear relationships** between features and target classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Correlation Plot:**  \n",
    "- A correlation heatmap shows how strongly each feature is related to others using a **color-coded matrix**.  \n",
    "- It helps detect **redundant features** that provide similar information (e.g., Energy and Loudness).  \n",
    "- It allows us to **select features that contribute unique information** to classification.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How These Plots Help Identify Optimal Attributes for Classification?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Pair Plot** allows us to visually assess which attributes exhibit **distinct clusters or trends**, making them good candidates for classification.  \n",
    "- The **Correlation Heatmap** ensures that we **avoid multicollinearity** by removing redundant features while selecting the most relevant ones.  \n",
    "- Features that have **strong relationships with the target variable** (or distinguishable distributions) are preferred.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Observations from the output (refer above result)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pair Plot Observations:**  \n",
    "1. **Energy vs. Loudness:**  \n",
    "   - There is a **strong positive relationship** between Energy and Loudness.  \n",
    "   - Since they provide similar information, we may use only one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Danceability vs. Valence:**  \n",
    "   - These two features show **some separability** in scatter plots.  \n",
    "   - They can be useful for classification, especially for song mood prediction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speechiness and Instrumentalness:**  \n",
    "   - These variables show **random scatter** with no clear pattern.  \n",
    "   - They may not contribute significantly to classification.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Correlation Heatmap Observations:**  \n",
    "1. **High Correlation:**  \n",
    "   - **Energy and Loudness (0.74)** → Strong correlation, so we should use only one.  \n",
    "   - **Danceability and Valence (0.47)** → Moderate correlation, meaning both can be useful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Low Correlation (Weak Predictors):**  \n",
    "   - **Speechiness and Instrumentalness** have low correlation with all other features, meaning they may not be strong predictors.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "Based on these observations, the **best features** for classification are:  \n",
    "**Energy** (or Loudness, but not both)  \n",
    "**Danceability**  \n",
    "**Valence**  \n",
    "**Views** (useful for popularity-based classification)  \n",
    "**Tempo** (based on some weak but potential influence)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Speechiness and Instrumentalness do not show strong relationships and may not be helpful for classification.**"

    "- **Cluster 0 (Purple)**: Represents songs with lower energy and varying levels of likes.\n",
    "- **Cluster 1 (Teal)**: Represents songs with moderate to high energy and a wide range of likes, including some of the most popular songs.\n",
    "- **Cluster 2 (Yellow)**: Represents songs with very low energy and generally fewer likes.\n",
    "- The clustering suggests that **energy plays a role in song popularity**, but other factors likely contribute to higher engagement levels (likes).\n",

    "### **3. Key Takeaways**\n",
    "1. **Songs with higher energy tend to have more likes**, but there are exceptions where lower-energy songs also receive high engagement.\n",

    "   - The **confusion matrix** indicates that most predictions are correct, but there are some misclassifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **K-Means Clustering**\n",
    "   - The **Silhouette Score is positive**, indicating good cluster separation.\n",
    "   - The **Davies-Bouldin Score is low**, which confirms well-defined clusters.\n",
    "   - From the clustering scatter plot, we see **energy influences song popularity**, and clustering successfully differentiates songs based on this factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overall Conclusion**\n",
    "   - Decision Tree is a **supervised learning approach** that effectively classifies songs into popularity categories.\n",
    "   - K-Means, an **unsupervised approach**, helps **identify hidden patterns** in the data, making it useful for segmenting songs into meaningful clusters.\n",
    "   - Both techniques complement each other: **Decision Tree predicts**, while **K-Means finds groups**.\n",
    "   - **Decision Tree:** High accuracy (85%), but struggles with \"Medium\" popularity classification.\n",
    "   - **K-Means:** Weak clustering (Silhouette Score = 0.198), suggesting no strong natural grouping.\n",
    "   -**Final Choice:** If classification is needed, Decision Tree is better. If the goal is exploratory clustering, K-Means is useful but needs better feature selection."

    "### **Proposed Solution for the Business Problem**  \n",
    "In Section 1, the business problem was to analyze IPL player performance over their lifetime and classify players into different performance categories. To address this problem, we applied **two machine learning techniques: Decision Tree Classification and K-Means Clustering**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Used for classifying players into predefined categories (High, Medium, Low performance) based on historical performance metrics.  \n",
    "- **K-Means Clustering**: Applied to group players based on similar performance patterns, allowing for an unsupervised approach to discover natural groupings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Learnings and Challenges Faced**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Data Preprocessing Challenges**  \n",
    "- Handling missing values in the dataset was crucial. Players with incomplete performance data required either **imputation** or **removal** based on relevance.  \n",
    "- Feature selection was key—some features had minimal impact on classification and were removed for better model efficiency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Model Selection and Justification**  \n",
    "- **Decision Tree was chosen** because of its ability to handle categorical and numerical data efficiently, interpretability, and ease of visualization.  \n",
    "- **K-Means Clustering was explored** to check if natural groupings exist among players without predefined labels. However, low silhouette scores indicated that predefined categories were more meaningful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Observations from Model Performance**  \n",
    "- **Decision Tree performed well**, achieving 85% accuracy, but misclassification occurred for \"Medium\" category players.  \n",
    "- **Confusion matrix revealed class imbalances**, requiring further fine-tuning such as hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.  \n",
    "- **K-Means clustering results were weak** (Silhouette Score = 0.198), indicating that IPL player performance doesn’t naturally form distinct clusters in the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Business Insights Derived**  \n",
    "- Teams can **identify top-performing players more reliably** using classification models rather than unsupervised clustering.  \n",
    "- If K-Means were to be improved, a better similarity metric or more feature engineering might be needed.  \n",
    "- Decision trees can be further optimized by **pruning techniques** to avoid overfitting and ensure generalizability across different seasons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Decision & Next Steps**  \n",
    "- **Decision Tree is the recommended model** for performance classification due to its high accuracy and interpretability.  \n",
    "- **K-Means clustering is not suitable** in its current form and would require additional refinement.  \n",
    "- Future work can explore **ensemble models** (e.g., Random Forest) or more advanced algorithms like **XGBoost** to enhance prediction accuracy.  \n",

    "# **8. Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Problem Recap**\n",
    "Music streaming platforms like **Spotify** and **YouTube** have different user engagement patterns. Some songs gain immense traction on one platform but underperform on the other. Our goal was to analyze what factors drive a song's popularity on these platforms and build models that can predict whether a song will perform better on Spotify or YouTube based on its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Proposed Solution**\n",
    "We took a **data-driven approach** to analyze song attributes and their impact on popularity across platforms. Our methodology involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**\n",
    "- We gathered structured data from **Spotify** (audio features like danceability, energy, tempo, etc.) and **YouTube** (views, likes, comments).\n",
    "- Data was cleaned, missing values were handled, and categorical variables were encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "- We visualized the distributions of various features, such as tempo, energy, and speechiness, across platforms.\n",
    "- Correlation analysis was performed to identify key attributes influencing popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Model Selection & Training**\n",
    "- We implemented **Decision Trees** to classify songs based on their platform performance.\n",
    "- We applied **K-Means clustering** to segment songs into distinct groups based on feature similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Evaluation & Insights**\n",
    "- **Decision Tree:** Achieved an accuracy of **85.01%**, with strong precision and recall values for each class.\n",
    "- **K-Means Clustering:** Evaluated using **Silhouette Score (0.198)** and **Davies-Bouldin Score (1.30)**, indicating moderate clustering quality.\n",
    "- Feature importance analysis helped us identify the most significant factors affecting song popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Challenges & Learnings**\n",
    "- **Data Disparity:** Some features were available only on one platform, requiring careful feature engineering.\n",
    "- **Feature Selection:** Not all audio features contributed equally to popularity, so we used statistical tests to refine our dataset.\n",
    "- **Model Comparison:** Decision Trees provided clear interpretability, while K-Means helped in unsupervised pattern discovery.\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics:** While accuracy was high, we also had to consider other metrics like F1-score and clustering validity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "- Songs with **high energy and danceability** tend to do well on **Spotify**.\n",
    "- **YouTube popularity** is more influenced by **engagement metrics** like likes and comments.\n",
    "- Predicting song performance is feasible, but platform-specific strategies are essential for marketing and promotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging **machine learning models**, we provided valuable insights that can help artists and labels optimize their **music distribution strategies** across platforms.\n"
